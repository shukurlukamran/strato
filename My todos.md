Random rational rss/budget/population/military/tech allocation.
- Attack/Military actions
- Resource usage (actions should use resources and each resource should at least have one use case)
- show what affets population how in its tooltip
- look at how infra and tech actually works
- Prevent cheating in the chat deals (you can get money for technology level now, but tech level isn't actually transferred, for example)
- AI should initiate deal requests too (to player and among each other - among each other can be done in the background without AI probably)
- Player shouldn't be able to see the "Propose Deal" button for their own country, it should only be shown for other countries.
